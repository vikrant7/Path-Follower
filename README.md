# Path-Follower
Description

This project is aimed at creating a robot which will be able to follow a path specified by the user on an arena.

The path will be drawn on a GLUT canvas. Path is basically a series of points interpolated with lines. Click feature is provided to specify the points of the path.
GLUT canvas is created using OPenGL in Visual Studio C++.
Data is sent to bot through bluetooth. Arduino is used for controlling bot and receiving data, which is done by attaching bluetooth module to it.
